* **Core Functionality:**

  * Language support: `It is mainly built for Salesforce code, but compatible with any text file. It helps developers find potential security vulnerabilities in their code early in the development process.`  
  * Command-line interface (CLI) for easy execution.  
  * Configuration options via a YAML and JSON file.
  * Introduced the official VS Code extension for ASIST, enabling direct IDE integration for SAST analysis.
