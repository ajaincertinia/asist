Using the VSCode extension is by far the easiest way to get started with ASIST.
When a file is opened or saved, ASIST will scan it to identify vulnerabilities.

Just like a linter, once the scan is complete, ASIST will annotate your code with the findings and the rule description. Findings can also be found in the "Problems" tab.

Workspace scans are also supported, making it easy to run ASIST on an entire project and address all your issues on the fly!

## üì¶ Installation

The extension is available on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=financialforce.asist).

## ‚ö° Extension commands

ASIST commands can be run in VSCode by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing `ASIST` to get the list of available commands.
Note that some commands will print results to the "Output" tab in VSCode (select `ASIST` in the channel dropdown).

![ASIST Extension commands](https://github.com/certinia/asist/blob/main/extension/image-1.png)

- **Run on file:** Runs a scan on the current opened file.
- **Run on workspace:** Runs a scan on the current project workspace.
- **List enabled rules:** Outputs a list of all the current enabled rules.
- **Create config file:** Creates a configuration file template if it doesn't exist.
- **Edit config file:** Opens the configuration file with custom rules, if it exists.
- **Preferences:** Opens the extension settings.

## üîï Marking false positives

When using the ASIST Extension, hover over an occurrence and click on `Quick fix...` option and select `Mark False Positive`.
This will add the placeholder `asist-ignore-begin` and `asist-ignore-end` comments around the affected line, and fill in the relevant rule ID.

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration file

Refer to the main [README.md](https://github.com/certinia/asist) for details on how to configure ASIST.
For the VSCode extension to pick up your config file automatically, the file must to be named either `.asist.yaml` or `.asist.json`, and must be located at the root of the workspace.

You can create a configuration file using the `Create config file` command, which produces a self-documented template.

By default, ASIST looks for a config file in the root of the VSCode workspace, but if you like, you can specify a specific config file path (relative to the workspace) in the extension preferences instead -- this can be useful when working with monorepos.

## üëæ Use a custom binary

This extension is shipped with prebuilt ASIST binaries, but if you need to specify a specific ASIST scanner location (which is very useful for developing new features!), here's how:

1. Open the ASIST `Extension settings`
1. Navigate to the `Workspace` tab
2. Enable the `Custom Binary Enabled` setting
3. Provide the path to your ASIST binary in `Custom Binary Path`
